This documentation describes YugaByte DB Enterprise for Pivotal Platform which contains two components:
YugaWare (YugaByte DB management console) in Pivotal Container Service (PKS) and the YugaByte Service Broker for Pivotal Platform.
YugaWare helps manage YugaByte Enterprise Edition by integrating orchestration, monitoring, and alerting all
in one application. The documentation also describes YugaByte Service Broker for Pivotal Platform.
The YugaByte Service Broker registers a service broker on Pivotal Platform and exposes its service plans on the Marketplace.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

YugaWare is a management console for YugaByte Enterprise Edition DB. It provides an interface to carry out various
Enterprise functions like software upgrade, backups, and alerts. Users can also use the management console to
monitor their DB performance by viewing the metrics. The management console exposes several of these functions' APIs as well.

The YugaByte Service Broker for Pivotal Platform registers a service broker with Pivotal Platform and exposes its service plans on the
Marketplace. Developers can then create service plan instances using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command
Line Interface (cf CLI) to bind them to their apps. The service broker talks to the YugaWare management console via
the API interface.
